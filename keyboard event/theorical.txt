Keyboard Events :
Keyboard events are used for handling keyboard actions, such as pressing a key, lifting a key, and holding 
down a key.

Event	               Description
keydown	             Fires once when a key is pressed
keyup	               Fires once when a key is released
keypress	           Fires continuously while a key is pressed
Although they look similar, keydown and keypress events do not access all the exact same keys. 
While keydown will acknowledge every key that is pressed, keypress will omit keys that do not produce a 
character, such as SHIFT, ALT, or DELETE.
