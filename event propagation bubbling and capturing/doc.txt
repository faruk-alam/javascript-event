Event Propagation :
In JavaScript,Event Propagation refers to how events travel through the Document Object Model (DOM) tree. 
The DOM tree is the structure which contains parent/child/sibling elements in relation to each other. We can
think of propagation as electricity running through a wire, until it reaches its destination. The event
needs to pass through every node on the DOM until it reaches the end, or if it is forcibly stopped.

Event Bubbling and Capturing :
Bubbling and Capturing are the two phases of propagation.In their simplest definitions, bubbling travels 
from the target to the root, and capturing travels from the root to the target. 
The target is the DOM node on which you click, or trigger with any other event.

For example, a button with a click event would be the event target.

The root is the highest-level parent of the target. This is usually the document, which is a parent of the
which is a (possibly distant) parent of your target element.

Stopping bubbling :
A bubbling event goes from the target element straight up. Normally it goes upwards till <html>, and then 
to document object, and some events even reach window, calling all handlers on the path.
