An event listener attaches a responsive interface to an element, which allows that particular element to 
wait and “listen” for the given event to fire.

There are three ways to assign events to elements:

Inline event handlers
Event handler properties
Event listeners

Inline Event Handler Attributes:
To begin learning about event handlers, we’ll first consider the inline event handler.

Event Listeners
The latest addition to JavaScript event handlers are event listeners. An event listener watches for an 
event on an element. Instead of assigning the event directly to a property on the element, we will use the 
addEventListener() method to listen for the event.

addEventListener() takes two mandatory parameters — the event it is to be listening for, and the listener 
callback function.
