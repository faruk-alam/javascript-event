Mouse Events
Mouse events are among the most frequently used events. They refer to events that involve clicking buttons 
on the mouse or hovering and moving the mouse pointer. These events also correspond to the equivalent 
action on a touch device.

Event	         Description
click	         Fires when the mouse is pressed and released on an element.
mouseup        Fires when the mouse is released on an element.
mousedown      Fires whe the mouse is pressed from an element.
dblclick	     Fires when an element is clicked twice.
mouseenter	   Fires when a pointer enters an element.
mouseleave	   Fires when a pointer leaves an element.
mousemove	     Fires every time a pointer moves inside an element.

A click is a compound event that is comprised of combined mousedown and mouseup events,  
which fire when the mouse button is pressed down or lifted, respectively.

Using mouseenter and mouseleave in tandem recreates a hover effect that lasts as long as a mouse pointer is 
on the element.
