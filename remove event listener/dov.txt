Javascript removeEventListener() is an inbuilt function that is used to remove an event handler that was 
previously added using the addEventListener() function to on a specific element.

Parameters:
It accepts three parameters which are specified below-

event: It is a string that describes the name of the event that has to be removed.
listener: It is the function of the event handler to remove.
