What's an Event?
Before we get into Event Listener, let's talk about what an event is. In the web world, an event is 
basically something that happens â€“ a click, a keypress, a mouse movement, you name it. These events can be 
captured and responded to using JavaScript.

The Event Listener
To catch these events, we use something called an event listener.An event listener is a mechanism that 
allows us to listen for specific events that occur on HTML elements, such as clicks, keypresses, mouse 
movements, and more. Event listeners allow us to execute code or trigger functions when those events 
happen.

The general syntax for adding an event listener to an HTML element is as follows:

element.addEventListener(event, callback);
